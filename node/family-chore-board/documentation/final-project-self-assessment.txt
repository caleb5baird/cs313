****************************
* The Project
****************************

1. Professional look and feel
  E - I feel that the parts of this that I got working look nice and feel smooth and seamless.

2. Accomplishes a meaningful task / does something interesting
  E - This is actually an app that my family is going to use when I actually finish it.

3. Demonstrates understanding of Node.js and Express principles
  D - I think this project demonstrated a good use of restful design and leverages the benefits of
  node.js and express. I do not mark it as E because I did not set up login on the client side. So
  although I do have the login page made (and it can be displayed by switching the display bool in
  the root react component "Choreboard") the server is not set up to handle authentication or
  session tracking.

4. Demonstrates mastery of Client-side and Server-side communication
  E - I think that the communication between the client and the server is really good. I think I
  have good endpoints and that the way that they are leveraged by the client is really good.

5. Overall Project
  D - I would say that on whole I would rate this project as "meets requirements" because although I
  did not finish even nearly all that I wanted to finish. I did show an understanding of the
  concepts of the class. And I did get the casework done for the rest of the project.``

6. Please write a short explanation / justification for selecting that category for your overall project.
  Oh ooops see above /:

7. (Optional) Any other comments about the project?
  The reason that I was not able to finish all of the things that I planned to was because learning
  and using react was more challenging than I thought it would be, and implementing the relation
  with dates so that the chore board will be able to keep track of history was much more challenging
  than I thought and required a complete refactoring of the database and the queries.
