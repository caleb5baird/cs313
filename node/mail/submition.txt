After completing the assignment, please answer the questions in this text file and submit it to I-Learn.

1. Copy and paste the URL for your web application:
  https://pacific-anchorage-41153.herokuapp.com

2. Copy and paste the URL for your source code repository (e.g., GitHub):
  https://github.com/caleb5baird/cs313/tree/master/node/mail/node-js-getting-started

3. Briefly list and describe the elements of the application that are functioning. Include any special instructions about how to login and/or use your application.
  It is fully functional albeit a little ugly. When the application is opened you are displayed with
  a selection field to select the type of mail. and a number field to enter the weight (in oz).
  After you enter those values you can submit the form to calculate the rate. If the weight that you
  entered is invalid it will notify you.

4. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.
  It is working correctly.

5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.
  I learned that in .ejs you can open an if statement in <% %> tags and then end the tag and put some plain html and then close the if statement in another set of <% %> tags!

6. In your own words, briefly describe the concept of a callback function and why it is useful.
  The idea of a callback function is that I have given a task to a function but do not want to wait around to tell it what to do when it finishes so rather I give it a function, so it knows to do whatever is in that function when it finishes.

7. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
D - Meets requirements

8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
  I just went through the requirements and filled them, I did not look for necessarily the "best" solution, nor did I add any extra styling or functionality.
